# LGL

LGL (Lite Graphics Library) is a graphics library written in C based on software rendering.

### Run tests

LGL uses [Ceedling](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling/tree/master) for building and running tests, so necessary dependencies are `ruby3` and `ceedling`.

To run tests, simply execute:

```bash
ceedling test:all
```

Make sure you have `ruby` in your `PATH`.
